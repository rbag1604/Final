ShopMe - E-commerce Fashion Website
Project Link: ShopMe - Live Website

Project Overview:
ShopMe is a dynamic e-commerce platform where users can browse through a variety of men's and women's fashion products. It offers a smooth and modern shopping experience with filters to help users find specific products. The website features a responsive design, ensuring accessibility on both mobile and desktop devices.

Key Features:

Landing Page: A visually appealing homepage with an introduction to the platform.
Routing & Navigation: Easy-to-use navigation to explore different categories and products.
Product Filtering & Search: Filter products based on categories and price range for a personalized experience.
Storytelling: Engage users with a compelling narrative about fashion and shopping.
Responsive Design: Ensures the site is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
Why React:
React was chosen for this project due to its powerful features that align perfectly with the project's needs:

Component-Based Architecture: React allows for the creation of reusable components, making development easier and more efficient. Components like product cards, navigation bars, and footer sections are reusable and easy to maintain.
Strong Ecosystem: React’s ecosystem provides essential libraries such as React Router for navigation, Context API for state management, and Styled Components for styling, allowing for better performance and scalability.
High Performance: React’s Virtual DOM ensures that only the necessary components are updated, leading to faster page loads and a smoother user experience.
Community Support: React’s vast developer community provides a wealth of resources, tools, and solutions that help address challenges quickly.
Agile Methodology:
For managing development efficiently, I used GitHub Projects to create an Agile board that tracks the progress of the project.

Epics:

User Management
Navigation
Filtering & Search
Storytelling
Features:

Implement Routing – React Router for page navigation.
Create Landing Page – Design a visually appealing homepage.
Add Filtering Logic – Implement product filters (by price, category).
Create User Authentication (Optional) – Allow user registration and login.
Design Product Pages – Create detailed pages for each product.
User Stories:

As a user, I want to search for items by keywords so that I can quickly find what I need.
As a user, I want to filter products by category and price range so that I can narrow down my search.
As a user, I want to view product details, including images and descriptions, to make informed purchasing decisions.
As a user, I want to easily navigate between pages and categories for a seamless shopping experience.
Web Application Features:
Landing Page:
The landing page is created using semantic HTML and is visually attractive, introducing users to the platform and its purpose. It includes animations for smooth transitions.
Routing & Navigation:
React Router is used to navigate between different sections of the site. The navigation bar has links to product categories, the homepage, and other important sections.
Storytelling:
A compelling narrative about the fashion journey and shopping experience is structured through React components. Sections include product highlights, testimonials, and the platform’s mission.
Data Handling & Filtering:
A JSON file stores product data, including images, prices, and descriptions. Filtering logic is implemented for users to filter products by category, size, and price range.
Styling & Presentation:
TailwindCSS is used for responsive design, ensuring a seamless user experience across different screen sizes. The design is simple, modern, and visually appealing to enhance the user’s shopping journey.
CI/CD Pipeline:
The deployment process is automated using GitHub Actions. Upon pushing changes to the main branch, the GitHub Actions pipeline automatically deploys the latest version of the website to Azure Static Web Apps.

CI/CD Documentation:

The GitHub Actions pipeline is set up to deploy the application automatically every time changes are pushed to the main branch.
Azure Static Web Apps ensures that the site is live and updated with the latest features and fixes.
Best Practices Followed:
Component-Based Architecture: The project is structured into reusable components for easy maintenance and scalability.
State Management: The Context API is used to manage application-wide state, including the shopping cart and filters.
Testing: Unit and integration tests were added using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure functionality and component behavior.
Accessibility: The application follows WCAG 2.1 guidelines to ensure it is accessible to users with disabilities, including keyboard navigation and ARIA roles.
Performance Optimization: The application uses React.lazy for code splitting, ensuring faster initial loads and better performance.
Future Scope:
User Authentication: Implement user login and registration for a personalized shopping experience.
Payment Gateway Integration: Add support for online payments to complete the shopping process.
Advanced Filtering: Add more advanced filters based on product reviews, ratings, and availability.
